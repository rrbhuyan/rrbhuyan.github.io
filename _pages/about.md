I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business. I am advised by Professor [Gourab Mukherjee](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/gourab-mukherjee) in the statistics group. I am broadly interested in machine learning and it's application in social science and business. Specifically, my research mainly focuses on developing novel statistical methods for granular level data analysis in complex high-dimensional settings. 

Prior to joining USC Marshall, I received my bachelor’s degree in 2018 and master’s degree in 2020 from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. In summer 2018, I visited Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins University where I was hosted by Professor [Vadim Zipunnikov](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~vzipunni/).
